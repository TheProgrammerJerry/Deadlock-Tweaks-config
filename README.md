## Deadlock Optimization Guide

### Steam Game Launch Options

To optimize your **Deadlock** gameplay, add the following commands to your launch options in Steam:

| Command          | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| `+exec autoexec.cfg`          | Executes a cfg file on startup |
| `-dx11`           | Using DirectX 11: Start parameters |
| `-vulkan`           | Using Vulkan: Start parameters |
| `-fullscreen`    | Forces the game to launch in fullscreen mode |
| `-high`          | Prioritizes the game in system processes |
| `-preload`       | Preloads game assets |
| `-forcenovsync`  | Disables vertical sync |
| `-m_rawinput 1`  | Ensures raw input is used for mouse movements |
|` +@panorama_min_comp_layer_cache_cost_TURNED_OFF 256 `| Optimizes UI performance  |




For use drx11(I would recommend): `-dx11 -m_rawinput 1 +exec autoexec.cfg -high -preload -fullscreen +@panorama_min_comp_layer_cache_cost_TURNED_OFF 256`

For use vulkan(Maybe better for AMD, you can just test it): `-vulkan -m_rawinput 1 +exec autoexec.cfg -high -preload -fullscreen +@panorama_min_comp_layer_cache_cost_TURNED_OFF 256`

Other recommended adjustments:
- **Particle Levels**: Reduced for minimal distraction and improved performance.
- **Ragdoll Effects**: Disabled to decrease CPU load.
- **Shadow and Lighting Effects**: Minimized to enhance FPS.

You can download the example [Video.txt](https://github.com/w0nxyApex/Deadlock-Tweaks-config/blob/main/video.txt). Make sure to check which FPS you are targeting and adjust frame times accordingly. Also, set the correct resolution for your display.
